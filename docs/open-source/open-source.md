[Probo](https://probo.ci/){:target="\_blank"} is Open Source so you can build your own server and run Probo on your own hardware or hosted solution. This is accomplished by installing a series of components that work together to make up the Probo system. Once these components are properly installed, configured and started you will have a working Probo server capable of doing roughly the same tasks as the existing Probo.CI SaaS web site.
