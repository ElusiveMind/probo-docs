## Setup Probo.CI for a Wordpress site that uses GitHub.

Probo.CI is here to make your development workflow more fluid. We want you to be able to configure Probo.CI to fit your project's needs. Below is a step by step example of a standard Wordpress site install with GitHub. This walkthrough does not use all the available parameters provided by the Wordpress plugin, but you can see more available parameters in the [Drupal plugin documentation](plugins/wordpress-plugin/ "Wordpress Plugin Documentation"){:target="\_blank"}.

You can find this Probo.CI example repository [here](https://github.com/Probo-Demos/wordpress_github){:target="\_blank"}.

**You will need:**

1. A standard Wordpress site with a MySQL database. **Note:** Currently databases must be collated 
2. Your code stored in a repository on GitHub.
