A Probo Organization is a grouping of Probo users, repositories, and billing information. The Probo Organization page in the Probo App is where Probo Admins can manage settings and view information specific to the organization as a whole such as the Subscription, Payment Method, or Payment History pages. Other Probo Users can view and create new builds in the Projects they have synced that they have access to in GitHub or Bitbucket, and are controlled by the Probo Organization.

A new Probo Organization is setup for the first repository enabled on each account you connect through GitHub or Bitbucket, whether it be an organization account or user account. Organization pages are accessed though a URL such as `https://app.probo.ci/#/dashboard/organization/ORGANIZATION-ID/overview`, where ORGANIZATION-ID is a unique identifier for the organization.
