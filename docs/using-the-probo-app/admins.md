Probo Admins are Probo Users that can perform administrative actions on your Probo Organization. A Probo Admin is a Probo User that originally activated a repository for a Probo Project, or has been added by another Probo Admin on the Admins tab in a Probo Organization after OAuthing with GitHub or Bitbucket and becoming a Probo User.

## Add Probo Amins

A user must exist in the Probo App in order to be added as a Probo Admin. Probo Admins can be added or removed to Probo Organizations independently from any GitHub or Bitbucket Organization. This eventually will allow non-developers to sign up as Probo Users to be added as Probo Admins to Probo Organizations to view and change important settings. Think of an employee from the Billing department being able to login directly with a Probo User to handle Subscriptions and Payment Methods, or view Payment History instead of having to have another GitHub or Bitbucket user in your organization.

**Note:** Admins will not automatically be applied from Organizations or Repositories in GitHub or Bitbucket.

Search using the autocomplete field to add an existing Probo User as a Probo Admin on a given organization.
