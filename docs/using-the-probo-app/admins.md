Probo Admins are users that can perform administrative actions on your Probo Organization. The original Probo User who enables the first repository becomes the first Probo Admin and can add other Probo Users as Admins to the Organization.

## Add Probo Amins

A user must exist in the Probo App in order to be added as an Admin. 

**Note:** Admins will not automatically be applied from Organizations or Repositories in GitHub or Bitbucket.

Search using the autocomplete field to add an existing Probo User as a Probo Admin on a given organization.
