A Probo Subscription is required to create builds. Probo Subscription plans are offered by the allotted Disk Space for builds to run before they are deleted by the Probo Reaper. When signing up for Probo for the first time, a 30-day trial period is given to new users to try out the Subscription plan they feel their organization needs. 

The Subscription tab in a Probo Organization is where a Probo Admin can select the Subscription level that your Probo Organization needs to run it's projects builds. Your organization can start out in the middle witha Silver Plan and upgrade or downgrade your Probo Subscription at any time. All Probo Subscriptions are pro-rated to ensure you are only charged for the services you use.
