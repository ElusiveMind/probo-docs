A Probo Subscription is required to create builds. Probo Subscription plans are offered by the allotted Disk Space for builds to run before they are deleted by the Probo Reaper. When signing up for Probo for the first time, a 30-day trial period is given to new users to try out the Subscription plan they feel their organization needs. Probo Organizations can view their current Subscription plan usage at the top of the page on any page inside of an organization or project in organization.

The Subscription tab in a Probo Organization is where a Probo Admin can select the Subscription level that your Probo Organization needs to run it's projects builds. Your Probo Organization can start out in the middle with a Silver Plan and upgrade or downgrade your Probo Subscription at any time. All Probo Subscriptions are pro-rated to ensure you are only charged for the services you use.

**Note:** If your 30-day trial subscription expires and no payment method is assigned eventually your account subscription will be disabled. You will need to contact Probo Support to re-enable the Subscription selection and Payment Method pages when this occurs. You should see a red notification at the top of the Probo App UI if your subscription has been disabled.
