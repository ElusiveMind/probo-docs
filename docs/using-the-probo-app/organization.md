A Probo Organization is a grouping of Probo users, repositories, and billing information. The Probo Organization page is where you can manage settings and view information specific to the organization as a whole such as the Subscription, Payment Method, or Payment History pages, as well as access all Projects and Repositories controlled by the Probo Organization. 

A new Probo Organization is setup for the first repository on each account you connect through GitHub or Bitbucket, whether it be an organization account or user account. Organization pages are accessed though a URL such as `https://app.probo.ci/#/dashboard/organization/ORGANIZATION-ID/overview`, where ORGANIZATION-ID is a unique identifier for the organization.
