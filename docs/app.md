## Using the Probo App
The [Probo App](https://app.probo.ci/ "Probo App") is your projectâ€™s Probo control center. It provides a user interface for accessing and managing your Probo environments.

### Probo Dashboard

Click the Activate Repos button to access a list of all available repositories. Probo.CI can be turned on and off using the toggle switches found next to each repository (green is on and gray is off). If you have added or removed repositories from your version control account, you can click the **Sync Repos** button to update the repo list in the dashboard.

### Probo Builds
Once your repositories are synced and you have begun using Probo, you can view all the Probo builds for each project. Each build contains a list of the test steps that were run, the log output for each step, and a link to the build itself.
