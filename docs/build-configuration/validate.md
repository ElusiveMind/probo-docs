Your Probo builds will fail if your configuration file contains invalid yaml. The simplest way to validate your `.probo.yaml` file is by pasting its contents into an online yaml linter, such as [http://www.yamllint.com/](http://www.yamllint.com/). We recommend linting your configuration file when you first write it and after you make any significant changes.
