Configuration examples are pre-written `.probo.yaml` configuration files you can use and amend to suit your particular needs. If you've written a rather clever and/or useful configuration file, consider [contributing it on GitHub](https://github.com/proboci/probo-docs#contribute-your-proboyaml-example). The Probo docs are open source, and pull requests are welcome!
