Probo integrates with [GitHub](http://github.com/), a popular git repository management system. On the GitHub pull request detail page, Probo utilizes the Status API to display the list of build steps, their status and a link to the Probo app for additional details. In this section the steps are carried out and updated in real time. Developers who are reviewing the pull request can immediately see whether any automated tests failed against a Probo site build.

Click the "Details" link next to any build step to be directed to the Probo app, where you can find the console output for each step and a link to the sandbox site.
