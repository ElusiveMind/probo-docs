Probo integrates with your git repository management system by displaying a real-time rundown of each step that you defined in your `.probo.yaml` file and whether the step passed or failed. Currently Probo can connect with [GitHub](/docs/git/github/ "GitHub Integration") and [Bitbucket](/docs/git/bitbucket/ "Bitbucket Integration") but additional integrations are in the works.
